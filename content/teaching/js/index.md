I have been both instructor of record of a series of undergraduate courses on Quantitative Research methods, as well as co-founding and creating content for a Ph.D. level methods "Bootcamp" for incoming Ph.D. students at UC Irvine. In both cases, the focus was on practical R knowledge with an approachable style.
