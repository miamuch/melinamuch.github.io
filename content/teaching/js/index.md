I have been both instructor of record of a series of undergraduate courses on Quantitative Research methods, as well as co-founding and creating content for a Ph.D. level methods "Bootcamp" for incoming Ph.D. students at UC Irvine. In both cases, the focus was on practical R knowledge with an approachable style. 

For Cal Poly Pomona, I tought Advanced Research Methods specifically, which is an upper division research methods course that focuses on giving undergraduates the statistical tools and foundations to conduct their own research. I bolstered the existing course design of the department by shifting the course from using SPSS, to using R software with my original training process. Students end the class by conducting their own research using skills we wet over like manipulating data and fitting multiple statistical tests in R software.

Here is a sampling of an online lecture I recorded for Cal Poly Pomona students in 2023. This lecture was about the object orientation of R, and preliminary coding.
