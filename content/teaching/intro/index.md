I taught an introductory course with 300 undergraduates addressing the fundamentals of American Politics as a fifth year graduate student. I managed four graduate Teaching Assistants during the course. I leveraged asynchronous and remote course design using Open Stax American Government 3E. My goal was to prioritize accessibility and critical thinking in the remote environment. Additionally, I pioneered novel tactics to address the presence of generative AI in the classroom while assigning essay based exams. I also managed four teaching assistants, where I focused on prioritizing student engagement with them while not overburdening their workload.
