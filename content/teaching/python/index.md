â€‹This was an upper division writing course that addressed how identity, namely race, gender, and sexuality frame American Political life. The course culminated in a 12 page research paper that allowed the students to produce quality social science research.  I focused on an innovative flipped classroom approach in a remote environment, which allowed for synchronous engagement from the students through small discussions and presentations. This course was designed with innovative course elements and guidance by Dr. Amber Spry.
