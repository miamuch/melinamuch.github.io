## About Me

I am a postdoctoral fellow for NYU's Center for the Study of Social Media and Politics. I attained my PhD in Political Science from the University of California, Irvine in 2024. I was also a visiting Ph.D. student with the Alvarez Lab at California Insitutute of Technology. For CSMaP, I specialize in the intersection of political psychology, survey methodologies, and social media in the American context.

In addition, I work on questions of identity politics and statistical methodologies to study intersectionality. I have also worked on questions of gender-based mobilization on social media during the #MeToo era and in the wake of Dobbs v. Jackson, as well as gender in podcasting relating to how it impacts politics.

Outside of work, Iâ€™m a former collegiate soccer player, avid lifter, mountain biker, and Dungeons & Dragons enthusiast. I enjoy long talks about the NWSL and anything San Diego (my hometown).
